Data set was pulled from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jeleeladekunlefijabi/ship-fuel-consumption-and-co2-emissions-analysis) for practice/personal use

The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

Ship Type: Categorizes ships into four main types: Fishing Trawler, Oil Service Boat, Surfer Boat, and Tanker Ship.

Fuel Consumption (Liters): The total fuel consumed by each ship type during operations.

CO2 Emission (Kg): The amount of carbon dioxide emitted based on fuel consumption.

This dataset was generated to simulate realistic maritime operations in Nigeria, taking into account common ship types, fuel usage patterns, and emissions.
